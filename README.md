# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the Mall Customer dataset. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and business strategy, as it helps in understanding the diverse needs of different customer groups and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customer dataset. It contains information about customers such as their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

- **Dataset source**: [Mall Customer dataset](link-to-dataset)
- **Features**:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `Gender`: Gender of the customer
  - `Age`: Age of the customer
  - `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
  - `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables (if any)
   - Scale numerical features
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the distribution of each feature
   - Explore relationships between features
   - Visualize insights using plots and charts
   
3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical clustering)
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score
   - Label each customer with their respective cluster
   
4. **Interpretation and Analysis**:
   - Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment
   - Interpret the findings and draw actionable insights
   
## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation-project.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the main script:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Results

- **Cluster Analysis**: 
  - Identified X clusters representing distinct customer segments
  - Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster
  
- **Insights**:
  - Cluster 1: 
    - Description of characteristics
    - Actionable insights
  - Cluster 2:
    - Description of characteristics
    - Actionable insights
  - ...

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project successfully performed customer segmentation using the Mall Customer dataset. By dividing customers into distinct segments, businesses can better understand their target audience and tailor marketing strategies to meet their specific needs.

## Future Work

- Experiment with different clustering algorithms and compare results
- Incorporate additional features for a more comprehensive analysis
- Deploy the model for real-time customer segmentation
